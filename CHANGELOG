15. May 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
+ Added possibility to set a required position-limit. If you wanna play on those servers you must have at least position <= limit (f.e. Top500-Servers).
+ New developing of HLstatsX-Proxy to send spoofed-packets over multiple servers.
+ Completely rewritten rcon-class since KKrcon version has a horrible way of working and performance problems (Performance gain ~500%).
+ It is now possible to display statistics ingame in an own window.
+ Complete new ingame framework.
+ Possibility to detect bans and make the ban "global" on all servers.
+ Graphical display from the server load.
+ Player activity for ranking (inactive players are not displayed anymore).

Fixed: Many bugs. 


11. Apr 2005

- Changed master server protocol to submit players and top-players (HLstats_Server.pm). 


10. Apr 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
+ Changed way of socket handling. If no logs for parsing available hlstats optimizes the database, delete old events and can communicate with the master server (hlstats.pl).
- Empty servers are now reported to master server if MasterServerData > 0 (hlstats.pl and HLstats_Server.pm)


08. Apr 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
+ Option to track only configurated servers. This is a BIG security thing to older versions!
+ New way of configuration in hlstats.conf. Now you can configure every single server. (Needs to change ConfigReaderSimple.pm)
+ Support for master server communication (http://www.statsme.de/master)
- Changed standard config behaviour for server. For now almost all extended options are turned off.
- Changed MySQL-Table hlstats_Servers. You have to include on more field (players int(11) NOT NULL default '0')

Fixed: All known bugs (f.e. weblinks in navbar) 


04. Apr 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Reworked table design for better display on 1024x768. (game.inc, weapons.inc, players.inc, playerinfo.inc)
Fixed: Max-Players value is set automatically in database (HLStats_Server.pm) 


02. Apr 2005 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
+ Add possibility to get other players rank, session or kpd-data (Players userid as argument. f.e. "session 4501")
+ Statsme-events are only tracked if actplayers >= minplayers
Fixed: Hard-coded link to statsme.de in livestats (game.inc)
Fixed: Settings in the config-file now (hopefully) working, sorry for that :(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
+ Added configurations-options, now everybody (hello admins :D) can use this modifcation.

20. Mar 2005
